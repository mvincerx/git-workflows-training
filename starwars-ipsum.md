The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
=====================================================

Don't underestimate the Force. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Still, 
she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? What!?

What can be painted can be punished. What will you do to emulate Bob?

Princess Lea, are you there? I think she went out for lunch. I'm hungry for lunch too. Let's go! 

- I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate 
 it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from 
 here.
- No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…
- I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Then R2D2 glided in.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I 
expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm 
getting too old for this sort of thing. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no 
weapons. You can't possibly… Don't underestimate the Force.

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your 
fingers.The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your 
fingers. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? 
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Partially, 
but it also obeys your commands. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go 
home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their 
secret base. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. A tremor in the 
Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a 
diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and 
inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your 
fingers. You mean it controls your actions? I'm surprised you had the courage to 
take the responsibility yourself. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match 
for a good blaster at your side, kid.

You mean it controls your actions? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let 
go your conscious self and act on instinct. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. 
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be 
with you. What!? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will 
slip through your fingers. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a 
detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be 
no one to stop us this time!

*Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. The Force is strong with 
this one. I have you now. He is here. Don't underestimate the Force. Hokey religions 
and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.*

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You mean it 
controls your actions? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I 
supposed to fight? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good 
blaster at your side, kid.

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Don't be too proud of this 
technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is 
insignificant next to the power of the Force. Look, I can take you as far as 
Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. You're all clear, kid. Let's 
blow this thing and go home! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. 
What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle 
station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it 
as it is. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I 
want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Surrender to the power of the darkside.

That is, if you dare. I mean, listen. We've all been hanging out in this
hovercraft garage too long now. The fumes are getting to me. Do you think they
have beaches on Dantooine? 

:p

As Han Solo said, "Never tell me the odds." Unless I'm in Vegas. 

Alas, I find myself searching for my self. And because I have no self, but selves, savage 
they are savage and unruly. "I become destruction," as Oppenheimer said, quoting the 
Bhagavad Gita, before Hiroshima. Oh well, I digress. I guess I'm just a Obi-Wannabe. 

Han Solo said, with finality, "It's not my fault."

Biggs Darklighter here. I'm back from the dead to see my friend Sky Lukewarm-walker. He still around? 

I'm here!!!

Skywalker needs a special TCS light saber.
